<h2>How to Learn Spanish</h2>
<br />
<p class="whiteify"><a href="http://howlearnspanish.com/2015/03/learn-spanish-verb-conjugations/">Learning Spanish conjugations</a> in the right order is critical.  It is important to master the present tense first.  The past tenses should be learned after the present tense because they're used very commonly (the past tense accounts for 40% of all speech - the future tense is only 10% of all oral communication).</p>
<p class="whiteify">It's also important to learn the most commonly used words first.  The verbs "to be", "to have", and "to want" are used much more frequently than "to run" or "to pontificate" - it's much more efficient to learn the most commonly used verbs first.</p>
<p class="whiteify">A lot of language teaching resouces don't teach Spanish logically.  The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Spanish-Step---Step-Barbara-Bregstein/dp/0071463380">Easy Spanish Step-by-Step</a> book advertises that it helps "Master High-Frequency Grammar for Spanish Proficiency - FAST!" and it is intended for new language learners.  Page 4 of this book introduces the Spanish word for friendship (la amistad) which is the 1,232 most common word in the Spanish language according to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Frequency-Dictionary-Spanish-Vocabulary-Dictionaries/dp/0415334292">Spanish frequency dictionary</a>.  Page 5 introduces the word for manager (el gerente), which isn't even included in the 5,000 word frequency dictionary!</p>
<p>If you learn the 1,000 most frequently used words in Spanish, you will understand <a href="http://howlearnspanish.com/2010/08/how-many-words-do-you-need-to-know/">88% of all oral speech!</a>.  Our software will identify where you are in your Spanish learning journey and let you know how to study most effectively.  We use diagnostic exams to identify if you are a beginner and need to study the present tense or if you are advanced and should study the subjunctive tense.  Our tutors are trained to teach you what you should learn logically and efficiently.</p>
